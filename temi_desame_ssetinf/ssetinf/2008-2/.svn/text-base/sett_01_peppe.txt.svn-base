less carbon or fossil fuels

how? monitors, printers, storage devices, and networking and communications systems have to use less fossil ...

starting from:
    * Green use — reducing the energy consumption of computers and other information systems as well as using them in an environmentally sound manner
    * Green disposal — refurbishing and reusing old computers and properly recycling unwanted computers and other electronic equipment
    * Green design — designing energy-efficient and environmentally sound components, computers, servers, cooling equipment, and data centers
    * Green manufacturing - manufacturing electronic components, computers, and other associated subsystems with minimal impact on the environment


These four paths span a number of focus areas and activities, including:
    * design for environmental sustainability
    * energy-efficient computing
    * power management
    * data center design, layout, and location
    * server virtualization
    * responsible disposal and recycling
    * regulatory compliance
    * green metrics, assessment tools, and methodology
    * environment-related risk mitigation
    * use of renewable energy sources and
    * eco-labeling of IT products

examples: 
    1. server virtualization: more core in a single machine
    2. servers moved in island
    3. more netbook, less server
    4. kill winzoz
